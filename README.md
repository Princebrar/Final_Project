**Project Overview**

A software application called the Employee Registration App was created to make managing and enrolling employees' information easier. Users of this programme can add new employee data and do many criteria searches for current employees. The Blazor framework is used for the front end of the application, which is developed in C#.


**Functionality**

•	Navigate to the "Add Employee" page (/add_employee).

•	Fill in the required details such as First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, Phone Number, Gender, Address, and select the job applied for.

•	Click the "Submit" button to add the employee to the database.


2.	Searching for Employees

•	Visit the "Search Employee" page (/search_employee).

•	Enter specific criteria such as Employee ID, Phone Number, or First Name to search for employees.

•	Click the "Find Employee" button to display a list of matching employees.


3.	Viewing and Editing Employee Details

•	Upon finding a matching employee in the search results, click on the employee's name to load their details for editing.

•	Modify the necessary information such as First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, Phone Number, and Address.

•	Click the "Update" button to save the changes.


4.	Deleting Employee Records

•	While viewing employee details, click the "Delete" button to remove the employee from the database.


**Problem Addressed**
